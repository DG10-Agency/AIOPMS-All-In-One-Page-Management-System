= Installation =

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/aiopms-all-in-one-page-management-system` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.

= Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which AI providers are supported? =
The plugin currently supports OpenAI (GPT-4 + DALL-E), Google Gemini, and DeepSeek. Each provider has different capabilities and pricing structures.

= Can I use my own images instead of AI-generated ones? =
Yes! You can use the CSV import with image URLs or the manual creation syntax with `:*image-url` to use your own images.

= How does the page hierarchy work? =
Use hyphens to indicate child pages. Each hyphen represents one level of nesting:
* `Page` (level 0)
* `- Child Page` (level 1)
* `-- Grandchild Page` (level 2)

= Is schema markup automatic? =
Yes, schema markup is automatically generated based on page content and context. The plugin intelligently detects the appropriate schema type.

= Can I customize the AI prompts? =
Currently, prompts are optimized for SEO and business context. Future versions may allow more customization through filters and hooks.

= What happens if API calls fail? =
The plugin includes robust error handling. Failed API calls will show appropriate error messages and suggestions for resolution.

= Can I use this with any WordPress theme? =
Yes, the plugin is theme-agnostic and works with any properly coded WordPress theme.

= How does image generation work with different providers? =
Currently, only OpenAI supports image generation (DALL-E). Gemini and DeepSeek are for content generation only.

= Can I export my page structure? =
CSV export functionality is planned for future versions. Currently, you can use WordPress export tools.

= Is there a limit to how many pages I can create? =
The only limits are your server resources and API quotas. For very large sites, use CSV import and process in batches.

= How often should I update the plugin? =
Regular updates are recommended to get new features, security patches, and bug fixes.
